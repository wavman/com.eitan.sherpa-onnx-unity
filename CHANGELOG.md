All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http.keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.4-exp.2] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- Added built-in metadata and explicit model-file bindings for the sherpa-onnx Nemotron-3.5 560 ms int8 streaming model.

### Fixed
- Select `greedy_search` for online NeMo-family transducers. The native NeMo recognizer terminates the host process when configured with the previously forced `modified_beam_search` mode.

## [0.1.4-exp.1] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- Added CPU/CUDA execution-provider selection for Speech Recognition components.
- Added optional one-shot silent warm-up with load and warm-up timing diagnostics.
- Added strict Windows CUDA prerequisite and loaded-provider checks; CUDA failures are reported instead of selecting CPU automatically.
- Added a manually triggered, SHA-256-pinned installer for the official sherpa-onnx v1.13.6 / ONNX Runtime 1.27.1 CUDA 13.x runtime.

### Changed
- Windows CUDA runtime files are installed into the consuming project's `Assets/Plugins` directory and are no longer bundled in this package.
- Windows desktop speech recognition continues to resolve the FP32 model files; int8 selection remains mobile-only.
- Package metadata now identifies the Apache-2.0 package license and the `wavman` fork repository.

## [0.1.3-exp.4] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Added iOS platform support using iOS-targeted sherpa-onnx and ONNX Runtime static native libraries.
- Added documentation coverage for `SourceSeparationComponent`, `SpeakerDiarizationComponent`, the split realtime/offline speech recognition components, and the expanded runtime configuration API.

### Changed
- Updated bundled sherpa-onnx native libraries to v1.13.0.
- Updated the iOS native plugin layout to use bundled static libraries.
- Refreshed the bilingual package documentation and restored readable Chinese documentation text.

### Fixed
- Documented the missing runtime environment variables for download timeout, insecure download policy, and strict model hash validation.

## [0.1.3-exp.3] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- Updated bundled sherpa-onnx native libraries to v1.12.32 across all supported platforms (Android arm64-v8a/armeabi-v7a/x86/x86_64, Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS, iOS).

### Fixed
- Recompiled Windows x64 native plugin (`sherpa-onnx-c-api.dll`) for the correct x64 architecture; previously it was incorrectly built as ARM64, causing a load failure in Unity on Windows x64. ([#12](https://github.com/EitanWong/com.eitan.sherpa-onnx-unity/issues/12))

### Known Issues
- On Android `armeabi-v7a` (32-bit), some upstream native create/init paths may still be unstable for specific models or modules even though initialization is allowed and advisory warnings are reported.
- `arm64-v8a` remains the recommended Android target for production deployments.

## [0.1.3-exp.2] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Added runtime controls for model preparation and download security: download-attempt timeout, insecure-download toggle, and strict hash-validation toggle (ScriptableObject settings, environment overrides, and `SherpaONNXUnityAPI` accessors).
- Expanded built-in ASR model metadata catalog with additional sherpa-onnx model IDs to improve out-of-box coverage.
- Added tests for new environment overrides and strict/non-strict hash-validation behavior in model preparation.
- Added shared Android 32-bit runtime advisory reporting across runtime modules so packages can surface `armeabi-v7a` risk information without blocking initialization.

### Changed
- Updated bundled sherpa-onnx native libraries to v1.12.31 across supported platforms.
- Validated Android runtime behavior against the refreshed native binaries, including follow-up checks on 32-bit (`armeabi-v7a`) and 64-bit (`arm64-v8a`) device paths.
- Improved model preparation metadata validation flow to support async hash population with cancellation-aware networking.
- Updated editor settings UX and localization wiring for runtime properties, including the new download/hash security options and more robust localized property rendering.

### Fixed
- Fixed native config initialization for multiple modules so default string fields are preserved when marshaling C# structs into sherpa-onnx/ONNX Runtime create calls.
- Fixed strict-hash validation messaging and non-strict fallback behavior so missing hashes can proceed with explicit warnings instead of hard failure when strict mode is disabled.

### Known Issues
- On Android `armeabi-v7a` (32-bit), some upstream native create/init paths may still be unstable for specific models or modules even though initialization is allowed and advisory warnings are reported.
- `arm64-v8a` remains the recommended Android target for production deployments.

## [0.1.3-exp.1] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- Customizable model preparation pipeline with `PrepareOptions`, `PrepareContext`, and `PrepareResult`, plus structured error codes surfaced through `PrepareAndLoadModelWithResultAsync(...)`.

- Runtime override APIs for `SHERPA_ONNX_*` environment variables via `SherpaONNXUnityAPI` and runtime settings.
- New Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis sample prompt assets ("Samantha").
- Additional tests covering prepare rollback and runtime environment overrides.

### Changed
- Updated sherpa-onnx native dependency to v1.12.23 and refreshed platform binaries.
- Expanded `SpeechRecognitionModelType` coverage to improve model selection.
- Model preparation now uses the new result-based API; `PrepareAndLoadModelAsync(...)` is replaced by `PrepareAndLoadModelWithResultAsync(...)`.

### Fixed
- Resolved FunASR model initialization failures.
- Guarded Unity path resolution to run on the main thread to avoid threading errors.

## [0.1.2-exp.3] - 2025-12-08

### Changed
- Restructured the overall codebase, refactoring several module implementations to improve readability, maintainability, and architectural robustness.
- Optimized performance across core components to reduce overhead and improve runtime efficiency.

## [0.1.2-exp.2] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- Editor localization (English/Chinese) plus tailored inspectors and menu entries for every SherpaONNX Mono component.
- Drop-in MonoBehaviour components for ASR, VAD, punctuation, keyword spotting, audio tagging, speech enhancement, TTS, and zero-shot TTS, with shared microphone input streaming.
- New sample scenes for **Audio Tagging** and **Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis**, including prompt assets, progress UI, and updated demo scripts.
- `SherpaONNXUnityAPI` exposes runtime toggles (`SetAutoDownloadModels`, `SetFetchLatestManifest`, checksum cache helpers) so developers can apply the issue #4 recommendation directly from code.

### Changed
- Reorganized native plugins under `Runtime/Plugins` and refreshed sherpa-onnx c-api binaries across Android (ARMv7/ARM64/x86/x64), Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS, and iOS while trimming obsolete x86 DLLs.
- Expanded model constants/resolvers and added `ModelFileResolver` helpers so modules can prepare newer ASR/TTS/audio-tagging families with adaptive threading and clearer feedback.
- Updated editor tooling (model manager, settings provider, runtime settings utility) with localization and more robust streaming transcription deduplication.

### Fixed
- Hardened microphone chunking and streaming queues in demo scripts and the speech recognizer component to avoid duplicate transcripts and race conditions during teardown.
- Unified decompression helper and progress tracking to reduce stalls when preparing models from downloads.

## [0.1.2-exp.1] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- Integrated **Audio Tagging** module from Sherpa-ONNX for sound event recognition.
- Released Unity demo scene showcasing **zero-shot TTS** via ZipVoice (experimental feature).

### Changed
- Supplemented model metadata for various modules to enhance compatibility.
- Optimized decompression process; default extraction remains via SharpZipLib for cross-platform support.

### Fixed
- Resolved IL2CPP build issues by upgrading Sherpa-ONNX to v1.12.15 and restructuring native plugin directories. (https://github.com/EitanWong/com.eitan.sherpa-onnx-unity/issues/2)

### Known Issues
- **ZipVoice TTS Demo**:
  - Chinese prompts may produce intermittent white noise or distorted audio.
  - English prompts may fail during synthesis setup, leading to crashes.
  - Suspected cause: Inconsistent handling of eSpeak-NG data or voice selection in the native layer.
  - Note: This feature is **not production-ready** and is provided for evaluation purposes only.

## [0.1.1-exp.3] - 2025-10-17

### Changed
- Used a self-optimized and compiled sherpa-onnx.dll .NET library to enhance P/Invoke security and compatibility with the iOS platform. (https://github.com/EitanWong/sherpa-onnx/tree/unity)
- **License**: The project license has been changed from MIT to **Apache 2.0**.
- **Model Management Overhaul**:
  - The model registry (`SherpaONNXModelRegistry`) is now fully asynchronous, fetching the latest model list from GitHub releases instead of relying on a local, static manifest. This ensures access to the newest models without package updates.
  - The model downloader (`SherpaFileDownloader`) has been completely rewritten for improved robustness, featuring chunked downloading, automatic retry logic, network health checks, and adaptive concurrency.
  - Simplified `SherpaONNXModelMetadata`, removing the need to declare individual model files. The system now dynamically detects files after extraction.
- **iOS Integration**: Renamed iOS native libraries from `*.a` to `lib*.a` to align with standard conventions, improving compatibility with build systems.

### Added
- Added the functionality to fetch the model list from sherpa-onnx online by default.
- **Automatic English Casing**: ASR results in English are now automatically converted to proper sentence case (e.g., "hello world" becomes "Hello world."). This includes smart handling of proper nouns, acronyms (like "USA"), and contractions (like "it's").
- **Adaptive Performance**: Introduced `ThreadingUtils` to automatically adjust the number of threads used by ONNX models based on the device's CPU cores, memory, and platform (mobile/desktop), optimizing performance and power consumption.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused the offline speech recognition to crash on Android. (https://github.com/EitanWong/com.eitan.sherpa-onnx-unity/issues/1)
- **Microphone Lifecycle**: Improved microphone handling in demo scenes to ensure proper cleanup and prevent resource leaks when the application quits or the scene is destroyed.
- **Model Initialization**: Refactored module initialization to be more robust, providing clearer success/failure feedback and ensuring that native handles are correctly managed.

### Improved
- Improved the stability of model loading by using reflection to confirm that the model has been loaded.
- **Editor UX**:
  - The "SherpaONNX Models" editor window now uses a high-performance virtualized scroll list, allowing it to display thousands of models without freezing or slowing down.
  - A loading spinner is now displayed while fetching the model manifest, providing better user feedback.
  - Language filtering is now more intelligent, supporting multi-language models and providing a cleaner UI.
- **Demo Scenes**: All demo scenes now fetch the model list asynchronously and display a "Fetching..." message to the user, improving the initial user experience.

### Known Issues
- There is a problem with the official native library of sherpa-onnx on the iOS platform, which causes crashes. Waiting for subsequent updates to fix it.
