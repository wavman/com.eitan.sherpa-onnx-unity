# Third Party Notices

This package contains third-party software components governed by their respective licenses. The following sections provide the required legal notices and license information.

## CUDA runtime prerequisite

The Windows CUDA provider installer downloads the following files from the official sherpa-onnx v1.13.6 release at user request: `onnxruntime.dll`, `onnxruntime_providers_cuda.dll`, `onnxruntime_providers_shared.dll`, and `sherpa-onnx-c-api.dll`. CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN, and the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime are system prerequisites and are intentionally not redistributed by this package. The installer records and verifies the release archive SHA-256 before extracting only those four files.

## sherpa-onnx

This package uses the sherpa-onnx library for speech recognition and synthesis functionality.
